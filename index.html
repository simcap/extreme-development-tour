<section>
  <p>This summer 2013, we embark on a one week tour of the companies that change software development everyday.</p>
  <p>We intend to visit their offices, see how they work, interview them, pair programm with them and then share that experience with the developer community back in France.</p>
  <p>Our main goal is to show that happy developers make great software.</p>
  <p>Check our posts below to see where we're at.</p>
